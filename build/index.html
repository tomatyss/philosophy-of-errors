<ol type="1">
<li>“The Error Spectrum: Mapping Cognitive Fallibility”</li>
</ol>
<p>Question Addressed: What is the taxonomy of human error, and are all
mistakes qualitatively equal or part of a broader spectrum?
Breakthrough: Proposes the groundbreaking Error Spectrum Framework
(ESF), classifying mistakes into cognitive, volitional, systemic, and
existential categories, and explains their interdependencies.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>“Error Genesis: Origins of Falsehood in Thought”</li>
</ol>
<p>Question Addressed: How do errors originate in human cognition, and
what are the universal mechanisms behind faulty reasoning? Breakthrough:
Introduces the “Triadic Model of Misjudgment,” explaining that all
errors arise from perceptional distortions, logical disconnects, or
contextual oversights.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“Ethics of Mistakes: Morality in Error-Making”</li>
</ol>
<p>Question Addressed: Are all errors wrong, and do some mistakes have
moral value? Breakthrough: Argues for a nuanced view that sees certain
errors (e.g., errors arising from incomplete knowledge in good faith) as
ethically neutral or even necessary for progress. Introduces the
Deontology of Correction framework.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>“The Metaphysics of Failure: Ontology of the Mistaken”</li>
</ol>
<p>Question Addressed: Are errors merely absences of correctness, or do
they have intrinsic metaphysical reality? Breakthrough: Establishes that
errors are not just “non-truths” but occupy a distinct ontological niche
as “epistemic deviations,” possessing causal effects independent of
their falsehoods.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>“Errors in Science: The Constructive Role of Being Wrong”</li>
</ol>
<p>Question Addressed: To what extent do errors contribute to the
advancement of scientific knowledge? Breakthrough: Proves that paradigm
shifts in scientific theory often hinge on high-impact “productive
errors,” and formalizes the concept of “Error-Driven Epistemology”
(EDE).</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>“Being Human, Being Wrong: The Existential Dimension of Errors”</li>
</ol>
<p>Question Addressed: Why is error an unavoidable and even essential
part of the human condition? Breakthrough: Proposes the “Existential
Fallibility Premise,” which reframes error-making as not merely a defect
but a defining characteristic of human consciousness and identity.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>“The Error Correction Equation: Toward a Unified Theory of
Rectification”</p></li>
<li><p>Question Addressed: Can error correction be formalized into a
universal, interdisciplinary framework? Breakthrough: Develops the
“Universal Error Rectification Protocol” (UERP), which integrates
principles from cognitive science, philosophy, and systems theory to
optimize processes of identifying, understanding, and correcting
errors.</p></li>
<li><p>“Collective Fallacies: Errors at the Systems Level”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Question Addressed: How do systemic and collective errors form, and
what societal structures perpetuate them? Breakthrough: Unveils the
“Macro-Cycle of Collective Misjudgment,” which outlines how feedback
loops within complex systems (societies, organizations, and networks)
amplify and cement errors over time.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>“Aesthetics of Error: Beauty in Imperfection”</li>
</ol>
<p>Question Addressed: Can errors have aesthetic or artistic value?
Breakthrough: Argues that imperfection and error have played a
significant role in shaping art, music, and literature, establishing the
“Aesthetics of Imperfection” paradigm.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>“The Final Horizon: Can All Errors Be Eliminated?”</li>
</ol>
<p>Question Addressed: Is it theoretically possible to eliminate all
forms of human error, or are they structurally built into existence?
Breakthrough: Concludes that while some errors can be mitigated almost
entirely via technology and artificial cognition, existential errors are
inextricably linked to sentience itself.</p>
