## An Open Collaborative Initiative Exploring Error Theory

### About This Initiative

The Philosophy of Errors is an open, collaborative project dedicated to advancing our understanding of error theory across philosophical domains. Like a wiki for error philosophy, this initiative brings together researchers, students, and thinkers from diverse backgrounds to collectively build a comprehensive resource on philosophical approaches to error.

Our community values intellectual openness, rigorous scholarship, and interdisciplinary perspectives. All content is freely accessible, and contributions are welcome from anyone with relevant expertise or insights.
