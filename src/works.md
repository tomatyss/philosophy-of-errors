# Works

1. "The Error Spectrum: Mapping Cognitive Fallibility"

- Question Addressed: What is the taxonomy of human error, and are all mistakes qualitatively equal or part of a broader spectrum?
- Breakthrough: Proposes the groundbreaking Error Spectrum Framework (ESF), classifying mistakes into cognitive, volitional, systemic, and existential categories, and explains their interdependencies.

2. "Error Genesis: Origins of Falsehood in Thought"

- Question Addressed: How do errors originate in human cognition, and what are the universal mechanisms behind faulty reasoning?
- Breakthrough: Introduces the "Triadic Model of Misjudgment," explaining that all errors arise from perceptional distortions, logical disconnects, or contextual oversights.

3. "Ethics of Mistakes: Morality in Error-Making"

- Question Addressed: Are all errors wrong, and do some mistakes have moral value?
- Breakthrough: Argues for a nuanced view that sees certain errors (e.g., errors arising from incomplete knowledge in good faith) as ethically neutral or even necessary for progress. Introduces the Deontology of Correction framework.

4. "The Metaphysics of Failure: Ontology of the Mistaken"

- Question Addressed: Are errors merely absences of correctness, or do they have intrinsic metaphysical reality?
- Breakthrough: Establishes that errors are not just "non-truths" but occupy a distinct ontological niche as "epistemic deviations," possessing causal effects independent of their falsehoods.

5. "Errors in Science: The Constructive Role of Being Wrong"

- Question Addressed: To what extent do errors contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge?
- Breakthrough: Proves that paradigm shifts in scientific theory often hinge on high-impact "productive errors," and formalizes the concept of "Error-Driven Epistemology" (EDE).

6. "Being Human, Being Wrong: The Existential Dimension of Errors"

- Question Addressed: Why is error an unavoidable and even essential part of the human condition?
- Breakthrough: Proposes the "Existential Fallibility Premise," which reframes error-making as not merely a defect but a defining characteristic of human consciousness and identity.

7. "The Error Correction Equation: Toward a Unified Theory of Rectification"

- Question Addressed: Can error correction be formalized into a universal, interdisciplinary framework?
- Breakthrough: Develops the "Universal Error Rectification Protocol" (UERP), which integrates principles from cognitive science, philosophy, and systems theory to optimize processes of identifying, understanding, and correcting errors.

9. "Collective Fallacies: Errors at the Systems Level"

- Question Addressed: How do systemic and collective errors form, and what societal structures perpetuate them?
- Breakthrough: Unveils the "Macro-Cycle of Collective Misjudgment," which outlines how feedback loops within complex systems (societies, organizations, and networks) amplify and cement errors over time.

10. "Aesthetics of Error: Beauty in Imperfection"

- Question Addressed: Can errors have aesthetic or artistic value?
- Breakthrough: Argues that imperfection and error have played a significant role in shaping art, music, and literature, establishing the "Aesthetics of Imperfection" paradigm.

11. "The Final Horizon: Can All Errors Be Eliminated?"

- Question Addressed: Is it theoretically possible to eliminate all forms of human error, or are they structurally built into existence?
- Breakthrough: Concludes that while some errors can be mitigated almost entirely via technology and artificial cognition, existential errors are inextricably linked to sentience itself.
