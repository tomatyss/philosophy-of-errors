<ol type="1">
<li>“The Error Spectrum: Mapping Cognitive Fallibility”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Question Addressed: What is the taxonomy of human error, and are all
mistakes qualitatively equal or part of a broader spectrum?</li>
<li>Breakthrough: Proposes the groundbreaking Error Spectrum Framework
(ESF), classifying mistakes into cognitive, volitional, systemic, and
existential categories, and explains their interdependencies.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>“Error Genesis: Origins of Falsehood in Thought”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Question Addressed: How do errors originate in human cognition, and
what are the universal mechanisms behind faulty reasoning?</li>
<li>Breakthrough: Introduces the “Triadic Model of Misjudgment,”
explaining that all errors arise from perceptional distortions, logical
disconnects, or contextual oversights.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“Ethics of Mistakes: Morality in Error-Making”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Question Addressed: Are all errors wrong, and do some mistakes have
moral value?</li>
<li>Breakthrough: Argues for a nuanced view that sees certain errors
(e.g., errors arising from incomplete knowledge in good faith) as
ethically neutral or even necessary for progress. Introduces the
Deontology of Correction framework.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>“The Metaphysics of Failure: Ontology of the Mistaken”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Question Addressed: Are errors merely absences of correctness, or do
they have intrinsic metaphysical reality?</li>
<li>Breakthrough: Establishes that errors are not just “non-truths” but
occupy a distinct ontological niche as “epistemic deviations,”
possessing causal effects independent of their falsehoods.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>“Errors in Science: The Constructive Role of Being Wrong”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Question Addressed: To what extent do errors contribute to the
advancement of scientific knowledge?</li>
<li>Breakthrough: Proves that paradigm shifts in scientific theory often
hinge on high-impact “productive errors,” and formalizes the concept of
“Error-Driven Epistemology” (EDE).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>“Being Human, Being Wrong: The Existential Dimension of Errors”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Question Addressed: Why is error an unavoidable and even essential
part of the human condition?</li>
<li>Breakthrough: Proposes the “Existential Fallibility Premise,” which
reframes error-making as not merely a defect but a defining
characteristic of human consciousness and identity.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>“The Error Correction Equation: Toward a Unified Theory of
Rectification”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Question Addressed: Can error correction be formalized into a
universal, interdisciplinary framework?</li>
<li>Breakthrough: Develops the “Universal Error Rectification Protocol”
(UERP), which integrates principles from cognitive science, philosophy,
and systems theory to optimize processes of identifying, understanding,
and correcting errors.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>“Collective Fallacies: Errors at the Systems Level”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Question Addressed: How do systemic and collective errors form, and
what societal structures perpetuate them?</li>
<li>Breakthrough: Unveils the “Macro-Cycle of Collective Misjudgment,”
which outlines how feedback loops within complex systems (societies,
organizations, and networks) amplify and cement errors over time.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>“Aesthetics of Error: Beauty in Imperfection”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Question Addressed: Can errors have aesthetic or artistic
value?</li>
<li>Breakthrough: Argues that imperfection and error have played a
significant role in shaping art, music, and literature, establishing the
“Aesthetics of Imperfection” paradigm.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>“The Final Horizon: Can All Errors Be Eliminated?”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Question Addressed: Is it theoretically possible to eliminate all
forms of human error, or are they structurally built into
existence?</li>
<li>Breakthrough: Concludes that while some errors can be mitigated
almost entirely via technology and artificial cognition, existential
errors are inextricably linked to sentience itself.</li>
</ul>
